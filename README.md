This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business performance by integrating multiple data dimensions and interactive analytical components.

Key Features:
KPIs:
-Sales (₹2.3M) – Tracks total revenue generated.
-Profit Margin (12.47%) – Measures efficiency and profitability.
-Return Rate (5.91%) – Identifies the proportion of returned orders.

Dynamic Visuals:
